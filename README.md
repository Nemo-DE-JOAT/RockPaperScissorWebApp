# RockPaperScissorWebApp
The Rock Paper Scissor game. Two players simultaneously punch their  clenched fist against an open hand and shout “Rock, Paper, Scissor, shoot”. After saying shoot, they either show a rock, paper or scissor sign.
A winner is then determined as follows: 
• A rock crashes a scissor. So the player with a rock sign wins. 
• A paper wraps a rock. The player with a paper sign wins. 
• A scissor cuts a paper. The scissor player wins. 
If they both show the same sign, it is a tie. So in this Session we are going to create a web 
application that will simulate the Rock Paper Scissor game. A user will play the game against the 
computer. The game will be personalized, meaning each player will be addressed by their name. Any 
user playing the game will take the name of Sipho, and the computer will take the name of Siri.
